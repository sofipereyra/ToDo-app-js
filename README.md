# ToDo-App
Project that brings together all the concepts and tools acquired in the subject Frontend II.

It is a classic but effective task application, in which we can write down different activities that we are interested in doing. As often happens, these tasks are pending until they are completed at some point. The frontend connects with an API specifically prepared to act as our backend. In this way we will have the persistence of the data in our own DB.

This project is the opportunity to review everything learned and put into practice the tools we have thanks to Javascript. Programming has been said! ðŸš€
